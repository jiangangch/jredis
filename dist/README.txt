Note:

jredis-alphazero.jar includes just the classes for the JREDIS release.

jredis-alphazero-src.jar includes the core classes (only) and the source files suitable for use in an IDE to step into the code, if you wish.

jredis-alphazero-all.jar includes all the sources and classes for the
core, tests, bench, and examples.  Also included is a junit 3.8 jar.
This may be convenient for running the bench and test from the commandline.
